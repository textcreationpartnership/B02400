         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THE Letter that Major <hi>Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane</hi> brought from you was very welcome to me; the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for that I had inquir'd after you of many, and could never hear of you before, ſince the diſperſion at <hi>Briſtol;</hi> for though I find your Name now in the review of one of Dr. <hi>Clare</hi>'s Letters, yet, when I read that Letter, at firſt I took it to have been Dr. <hi>VVadſon;</hi> from whom I had (not long ſince) recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a Letter out of the Weſt; but I am glad it is you, and that you
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:174332:3"/>have <hi>(a)</hi> ſo fair a ſubſiſtence for the preſent, under ſo good a
<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>The Lord</hi> Hopton.</note> Lord: What will become of us all for the future, our Lord above knows; to whoſe Providence and Goodneſs we muſt recommend our ſelves.</p>
               <p>You ſay right, Our Church is as much miſunderſtood and miſconſtrued here abroad, as it is miſuſed and maligned at home; and I have had experience enough of both: The truth is, they are here ſo exceeding uncharitable, and ſomewhat worſe, that I know not how any man (who underſtands him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and makes a Conſcience of what he does) can enter into any Communion with them <hi>(b)</hi> in thoſe Doctrines and Practices which they hold neceſſary to Salvation; and wherein they make their eſſential note of difference, their Religion,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:174332:3"/>and their Church, to conſiſt. And, that I may anſwer your demand in brief (for they ſay you are all to come hither) it is far leſs ſafe to joyn with theſe men, that <hi>(c)</hi> alter the <hi>Credenda,</hi> the <hi>Vitals</hi> of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, than with thoſe that meddle only with the <hi>Agenda</hi> and <hi>Rules</hi> of Religion, <hi>(d)</hi> if they meddle no farther; and where it is not in our power to help it, there is no doubt, but in theſe things <hi>(e)</hi> God will accept the Will for the Deed, if that will (without our aſſent, or approbation to the contrary) be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved entire; though, in the mean while, we ſuffer a little for it, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion muſt not make us leave our own Church. They of <hi>Geneva</hi> are to blame in <hi>(f)</hi> many things, and defective in ſome; <hi>(g)</hi> they ſhall never have my approbation of their
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:174332:4"/>doings, nor let 'um have yours; <hi>(h)</hi> yet I do not ſee that they have ſet up any new Articles of Faith, under pain of Damnation to all the World that will not receive them for ſuch Articles, and <hi>(i)</hi> you know whoſe caſe that is; <hi>Caetera cum veneris,</hi> or (if you come not) in other Letters, as you ſhall offer me occaſion. In the mean while I will be glad to hear of <hi>(h)</hi> your reſolution ſtill to be conſtant in the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the Ancient Catholick Faith and Government of the Church of Chriſt, which the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath profeſs'd and taught us, though now there be a Cloud and Storm upon it, as upon what Church hath there not been, more or leſs in the ſeveral Ages of the World?</p>
               <p>If you know of any thing fit for me to hear concerning our old

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:174332:7"/>at home, though it be diſgraced and perſecuted there never ſo much. The time hath been wherein good Orthodox <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have ſuffered more than we do, and continued firm and conſtant in their way: Nor do I ſee any better way to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our ſtation again than this; however, <hi>(c)</hi> let it never be ſaid, that to revenge our ſelves upon one Enemy we have any mind to comply with another, you know whom I mean, an Enemy as bad, if not worſe than thoſe that are at home.</p>
               <p>I would you held the ſame courſe at <hi>Jerſey,</hi> and had the ſame tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there that we have at our Court, where we omit nothing that we were wont to practiſe in <hi>England;</hi> and are ſo far from leaving off the Surplice at Service, that we never Preach any Sermon without it: And in theſe our

That I ſhould declare Mr. <hi>Gatford</hi> for a pattern of Legal Conformity to all <hi>England</hi> (unleſs it were upon his profeſſion, that he would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve all things, which the <hi>(g)</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of our Church legally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded) I hope you do not believe, more than I, nor <hi>(h)</hi> that I had any hand in offering him the Maſterſhip of <hi>Jeſus Colledge,</hi> when Doctor <hi>Sterne</hi> was placed there, for at that time I was <hi>200</hi> miles off, and had no thought of reſiding in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, whither I was called by the

When the Liturgy was ſet forth, and commanded to be uſed, theſe <hi>Pſalms</hi> were not half of them
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:174332:9"/>compoſed: No Biſhop ever enquired of their obſervance, nor did ever any Judge, at an Aſſize, deliver them in his Charge, which both the one and other had been bound to do, if they had been ſet forth by the ſame Authority which the Liturgy was: Beſides, you may obſerve, that they are never Printed with the Liturgy, or Bible, nor ever were, but only bound up, as the Stationers pleaſe, together with it; other whiles, that, by this means, their <hi>Pſalms</hi> might vent the better, and they get the more gain. I know not what they talk of Scandalizing weak Conſciences, but I am as ſure as you are, that many paſſages in thoſe <hi>Pſalms</hi> have been ſcandalous enough. Theſe things (when you have juſt occaſion) you may aſſert for truth, but you need not quote any other Author than your

            </opener>
            <p>THE Original of this Device was not in <hi>England,</hi> but firſt taken up by one <hi>Clement Marot,</hi> a Groom of the Bed-Chamber to the <hi>French</hi> King, <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt; a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty man, that had a natural Vein of facile Poeſie in that Language; wherewith he diverted that King often, who was much delighted with him, until by converſing with the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> he had got a tincture of their good Fellowſhip, and Religion too; an intimation whereof being made
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:174332:12"/>to the King, he was fain to fly the Court, and betake himſelf to the protection of Q. <hi>Margaret de Valois,</hi> the Kings Siſter, (<hi>vetus reorum aſylum,</hi> ſays <hi>F. Strada</hi>) until the Kings indignation ſhould be appeaſed, as after a while it was; which encouraged him to return to <hi>Paris,</hi> where he was prevailed with by <hi>Fr. Vetablus,</hi> Profeſſor of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh his trifling Doggrel, and betake himſelf to a more ſerious and ſolemn task, of turning <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>Pſalms</hi> into <hi>French</hi> Metre, as he did the firſt fifty, but ſo unskilſully and perverſly, as being a perſon utterly illiterate (ſetting his Rhiming vein aſide) <hi>diſciplinarum homo omnium apprime rudis, (Strada)</hi> that, though the King ſung them, as he had done his former Ballads, now and then; upon juſt complaints made to his Majeſty by the Doctors of the <hi>Sorbone,</hi> an Edict was made, That nothing of <hi>Marots</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure ſhould be publiſhed ever after: Yet ſo fond were the common people of this novelty (and the more, perhaps, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe forbid) that, new Tunes being ſet to 'em, ſing 'em they would; and ſo well was he pleaſed with their applauſe, that by his folly and licentious language, he
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:174332:12"/>betrayed the ſafety he had recovered, and took his flight to <hi>Geneva,</hi> where well acquainted he became with <hi>Beza;</hi> yet not ſo, as to be protected by him againſt Publick Juſtice, which, for ſome Crimes he had there committed, whipt him out of the Town, and ſent him away to ſeek ſanctuary ſomewhere elſe: But in tract of time, ſo much kindneſs had <hi>Theodore Beza</hi> for the repute of his old acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as he finiſhed the imperfect work, by Tranſlating into better Rhime and Senſe the other hundred <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring his deceaſed Friend with an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy in <hi>French</hi> metre: I am to add, that with ſuch allectation they were Tuned by the Muſick-maſters, whom <hi>Beza</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected for that employment, as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witcht the multitude, and won the good liking of others, that had more refined Ears, and nicer Fancies, ſo as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the <hi>Sirens,</hi> and <hi>Tarantalus,</hi> of Sea and Land; all people, that were not wiſe enough to foreſee the miſchief they were to produce, and honeſt enough to have no hand in it, being invited to join in conſort and meaſure, which way ſoe're they turned themſelves, or with whom ſoever they converſed; <hi>in coctibus, in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viis,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:174332:13"/>in officinis;</hi> in Temples, in the Tradeſmens Shops, in the Travellers Roads and Walks, in all the crooked and by-ways of the <hi>French</hi>-Reformed.</p>
            <p>Now had all this been done in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout zeal, though with a mixture of ſome ſuperſtition, it would not have been ſo blame-worthy; but when, afterward, it proved a prime incentive to Rebellion, and the <hi>New Pſalter</hi> (ſo they called it) lifted up as an Enſign for all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, Sacrilegious wretches to aſſemble at, and march after; the true intent was then diſcovered, and, by, frequent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlances, was manifeſted, in all parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> where it got entrance, that this ſoft Muſick wrought worſe effects than the Warlike Drum, or loudeſt Trumpet of Sedition. One or two inſtances of which miſchievous and profane abuſe I could here inſert; but becauſe I find Monſieur <hi>Maimbourgh</hi> ſomewhat more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular than <hi>Fam Strada,</hi> as to what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns <hi>Cl.

            </p>
            <p>That he was born in <hi>Aquitain,</hi> I think, both agree; in <hi>Diveana Cadurcorum,</hi> ſays the one; <hi>Natif de Cahors,</hi> the others.</p>
            <p>That, having lived too much a Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, and thereby become obnoxious to the cenſure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of thoſe in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, he betook himſelf to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed party, againſt whom the King, his Maſter, having publiſhed very ſevere Edicts, and declared his reſolution, not to ſpare any perſon that ſhould deſert the Religion himſelf profeſſed: <hi>Marot,</hi> fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an arreſt, retired, and lived at <hi>Bearne;</hi> and after ſome time went farther off, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the <hi>Alpes,</hi> to <hi>Ferrare,</hi> applying himſelf to the Dutcheſs <hi>Renee,</hi> who uſed to take into protection all the Proteſtants that fled to her, as ſhe did him; and not only ſo, but obtained his Pardon and Peace from the King; and prevailed for his return to Court, engaging her Word and Honour for his good behaviour; in reſpect whereunto, eſpecially, it was, that he complied ſo readily with the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of the learned <hi>Vatablus,</hi> for turning the <hi>Pſalms</hi> into Metre, which the ſaid Profeſſor firſt interpreted for him out of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:174332:14"/>the <hi>Hebrew</hi> into Proſaic <hi>French;</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which preparatory aſſiſtance, both tranſlation, and paraphraſtical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation, ſo dull was he of apprehenſion, as he is reported to have committed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny foul faults; two of which ſort they take particular notice of, in the very firſt <hi>Pſalm</hi> he entered on, which, if <hi>Vatablus</hi> had called his Scholar to account for the task he had put upon him, methinks might have been amended before they came out in Print, though the Majeſtick ſtyle of the Prophet himſelf, it was not expected, he ſhould keep up, much leſs improve to that height, which aſcendant Poetry is wont to do, and their more learned Paraphraſt, Biſhop <hi>Godeau,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, ſome his admirers think, has ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>
            <p>This firſt eſſay at <hi>Paris</hi> ended with the thirtieth <hi>Pſalm,</hi> the Doctors in Theology there remonſtrating to the King, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be more dangerous than <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rots</hi> Verſion of the <hi>Pſalms</hi> (<hi>cette infidelle fraduction,</hi> as they ſtyled it) for which, and ſomewhat elſe, they pretended to have diſcovered of him, he made ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eſcape to <hi>Geneva,</hi> where his old friend Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> ſays the <hi>Sieur Maim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourgh,</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:174332:14"/>encouraged him, notwithſtanding, to adventure at twenty more, as he did, with no better ſucceſs than the former; yet what they wonder at: ſomewhat more is, that while he was ſo well em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed upon ſo divine a ſubject, his courſe of life was not more reformed, than to relapſe there into ſuch a hainous crime, as for which Sentence of Death paſſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him by the publick Magiſtrate; and had been executed, if <hi>Calvin</hi>'s intereſt had not commuted it with the publick laſh about the <hi>Carfouo:</hi> After which ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, and diſgrace, he fled toward the <hi>Alpes,</hi> and kept cloſe in <hi>Piemont,</hi> and there died a <hi>Huguenot,</hi> about the ſixtieth year of his age. But this goes upon the Sieur <hi>Maimbourgh</hi>'s credit; for, it's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, I have not met with it in any of the Reformed Writers I have had in hand.</p>
            <p>The other hundred <hi>Pſalms,</hi> he agrees with <hi>Strada,</hi> were verſified by <hi>Beza;</hi> and, when finiſhed, bound up with the <hi>Geneva Bible,</hi> and otherwhile with <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>'s <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> the better to diſperſe them, with their Reformation, about the Countreys, and ſweetly to propagate their Rebellion by 'em. Their firſt exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of this new harmony was in and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:174332:15"/>about <hi>Paris,</hi> where people moſt frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a pleaſant walk; which the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> took for a high affront, no leſs to be <hi>Sung</hi> than <hi>Beaten</hi> out of their <hi>Promenade;</hi> inſomuch as the <hi>Pariſians,</hi> that were zealous the other way, reſolved to Arm, and to aſſault them in a fit of fury, but that the care and courage of their Magiſtrate prevented, by allaying the tumult, and impriſoning two obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the moſt earneſt to chant their <hi>Pſalms</hi> in this Seditious manner. But this, alas, was nothing to what followed in greater numbers; Not to mention the fray ſeven or eight hundred of them made in <hi>Vaſſy,</hi> where the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> travelling one <hi>Sunday, Anno</hi> 1562. made a little ſtay on purpoſe to hear Maſs; at which time the foreſaid number being met in a Grange (as rendered) adjoining to the Church, where his Highneſs was on his knees; they having ſome notice of it, elevated their voices to ſuch a height, in chanting <hi>Marot</hi>'s <hi>Pſalms,</hi> as diſturbed the Prince at his Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; whereupon two or three of his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers but deſiring them to forbear a while, or at leaſt to ſing ſomewhat lower, they, inſtead thereof, raiſed their note to a louder Tune, made a fierce ſally out on
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:174332:15"/>his company, which were not more than a fourth part of themſelves, yet with drawn Swords in their hands offered to encounter 'em, but it came to throwing of Stones at laſt; with one of which, the Duke himſelf, who was fain to quit his Church, receiving a ſhrewd blow on his Jaw, became all bloody; which incenſed his followers ſo, as they made uſe of their Weapons, and ſome few were killed, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like what could, in reaſon, merit the odious character of a Maſſacre, though not other than ſuch by the <hi>Huguenots</hi> was it reported at Court, and accordingly complaint made of it to the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre,</hi> as a manifeſt infraction of his late Edict for Pacification; which was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe reſented by him, as appeared by the check he gave to <hi>Mezeray, cet inſolent Miniſtre,</hi> as he called him, not liking what he had miſrepreſented of this affair.</p>
            <p>More inexcuſable was the greater tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult at <hi>Valenciennes,</hi> the chief City of <hi>Haynalt;</hi> and <hi>Tournay</hi> the chief City of <hi>Flanders Gallicant;</hi> where the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> began to try their fortune in thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, which lay next to <hi>France:</hi> In the firſt of which, the Preacher having ſiniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Market-place, where he made
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:174332:16"/>his Sermon, was followed in the Streets by no fewer than one hundred people; but, in the other by a train of ſix hundred, or thereabouts, all of them ſinging <hi>Davids Pſalms</hi> of <hi>Marot's</hi> Tranſlation, according to the cuſtome of the <hi>Hugonots</hi> amongſt the <hi>French.</hi> Some tumults hereupon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued in either City, for the repreſſing whereof, <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Momorancy</hi> Lord of <hi>Montigny,</hi> being the Governour of that Province, rides in poſt to <hi>Tournay,</hi> hangs up the Preacher, ſeizeth on all ſuch Books as were thought Heretical, and thereby put an end to the preſent Sedition. But when the Marqueſs of <hi>Bergen</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to do the like at <hi>Valenciennes,</hi> he told the Governeſs, in plain terms, that it was neither agreeable to his place, or nature to put an Heretick to death, (which had been a good Chriſtian anſwer, if the Rioters had not been more Rebels, than Hereticks, and Fellons certainly, becauſe Sacrilegious robbers, here in <hi>Purpoſe,</hi> as elſewhere, divers parties of them in <hi>Fact,</hi> which occurr in the Hiſtories of both Countries; for theſe tumultuous waves were rolling directly toward the <hi>Dominican</hi> Cloyſter, which the Rebels had in deſign to ſack, and then ſet in flames. But,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:174332:16"/>changing their mind on a ſudden, they diverted toward the Priſon, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed then to the number of two thouſand, forced the Gates, and ſet at liberty two of their company, whom the publick Magiſtrate had ſeized on and clapt up there; ſending him a modeſt meſſage, (if you will ſo take it, and not rather for a jeer or ſcorn) that they had not acted, nor intended more: But, at ſome months diſtance afterward, they paid their due to Juſtice, one of the two reſcued Priſoners, who was retaken, and divers others who either were, or boaſted themſelves, as if they had been, principals in the tumult, —<hi>qui tumultum aut animoſius fecerant, aut jactantius ſibi vendicaverant,</hi> are <hi>Strada</hi>'s words, ſomewhat more particular than what I borrowed before from our own Hiſtorian; who yet addeth hereunto (what ſeems likewiſe to be taken from him) Thoſe of <hi>Valenciennes</hi> had refuſed to admit a Garriſon, encouraged by their <hi>French</hi> Preachers to that diſobedience, but being beſieged by <hi>Norcarmius,</hi> Deputy-Governour of <hi>Haynalt</hi> for the Marqueſs of <hi>Bergen,</hi> they were compelled, in the end, to ſubmit to mercy, which was ſo inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed with Juſtice, that thirty-ſix of the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:174332:17"/>Incendiaries were beheaded, ſome of their Preachers hanged, and ſome Souldiers executed; the Liberties of the City being ſeized, and declared to be forfeit, till the King ſhould be pleaſed to reſtore them. If I would yet enlarge upon the rebellious attempts, and outrages, which the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Flemiſh Calviniſts</hi> daily multiplied, and proſecuted with ungovern'd zeal (if not rather ſanatick fury) I could tranſcribe Volumn, and be no more a plagiary than they that have writ before me, (for Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is not to be invented, but taken upon truſt by us that are at diſtance from the tranſactions of it) but I will chuſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit you, Sir, unto the triumvirate I have had occaſion to cite hither more than once, and borrow the concluſion only of a more doleful Tragedy, acted by them at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> the chief City of <hi>Brabant,</hi> where after ſome calmer Scenes, or little eſſays made of their following miſchief, being become not only more numerous, but better armed, they marched confuſedly, not in Rank and File, to the chief Church of that City, at the Evening Service; which ended, they compel the people to forſake the place, and poſſeſs themſelves of it; having made faſt the doors, for
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:174332:17"/>fear that ſome diſturbance might break in upon them, one of them begins to ſing a <hi>Pſalm</hi> in <hi>Marots</hi> Metre, wherein he is followed by the reſt; that ſuch a holy exerciſe as they were reſolved on, might not be undertook without ſome preparation; which fit of Devotion, or Profanation rather, being over, they fell to work; firſt they pulled down a maſſy Image of the Virgin, and ſuch other Saints as they found advanced there, on their ſeveral Pedeſtals, offering many indignities to thoſe repreſentatives, and the others Painted on Walls or Windows, beſide many unhandſome uſages of what the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks account moſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, demoliſhing all they could: And this they did with ſuch diſpatch, ſo eaſily and pleaſantly goes off a hand the hardeſt work, (when facilitated by the tune of a <hi>Pſalm,</hi> ſelect, and appoſite, as, no doubt, it was) that one of the faireſt Churches in <hi>Europe,</hi> richly adorned with Statues and Maſſie Images of Braſs and Marble, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in it no fewer than ſeventy Altars, was, in the ſpace of four hours, defaced ſo miſerably that there was nothing to be ſeen in it of the former beauties: Proud of which fortunate ſucceſs (ſo my Author
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:174332:18"/>continues) they brake into all other Churches of that City, where they acted over the ſame ſpoils, and outragious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolencies; and afterwards forcing open the doors of Monaſteries and Religious Houſes, they carried away all their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated Furniture, entred Store-houſes, ſeized on their Meat, and drank off their Wine; and took from them all their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, Plate, and Wardrobes, both Sacred and Civil, not ſparing any publick Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary, whereſoever they came: A ruine not to be repaired but with infinite ſumms; the havock which they made in the great Church only, being valued at four hundred thouſand Ducats, by indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent rates; whereunto is added, That the like outrages they committed at the ſame time in <hi>Gaunt</hi> and <hi>Oudenard,</hi> and all the Villages about them: That, in the Province of <hi>Flanders</hi> only, no fewer than four hundred conſecrated places were, in the ſpace of ten days, thus defaced, and ſome of them burnt down to the ground. A bleſſed Character, among thouſands more, of <hi>Presbytery</hi> and <hi>Geneva</hi> Jiggs, as ſome ſlightingly call them.</p>
            <p>All which makes me, not a little, to admire the fond and facile connivance of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:174332:18"/>our Reforming Anceſtors, in or about the ſixth year of K. <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. and afterward, in the Reign of the glorious Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> that is, at the entrance, and intermediate continuance, of a like, or, in good truth, a far worſe tranſlation, a meer Rhiming Paraphraſe, into, and in, the Churches they were then planting, or purging from all Superſtition and Profanation, having ſo freſh and ſo notorious a Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent before their Eyes of what had been wrought, by the ſame model, in foreign Countreys: Of which I can conceive no better reaſon, (if I may be licenſed to render any) than, for the firſt, a little inclinations, the Protector, and ſome in Council, had to the <hi>Geneva</hi>-Platform, ſo ſoon as <hi>Calvin</hi> had put in his Finger, and offered the further aſſiſtance of his Head (and Heart too) toward perfecting the work they were about. And, for the latter, ſome little politick compliance (ſo much as is ſignified) with them whom the Queen ſupported by Men and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, to prevent, perhaps, the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>growing of either Monarchy, though to the no ſmall hazard of ruining her own, in this Century (as may be apprehended) from Divine Juſtice; that in a ſeaſon,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:174332:19"/>which we may not underſtand as ſuch, will vindicate the general right of Kings to the exact obedience of their Subjects, by ſome particular judgement on their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or Succeſſors, who have acted ought toward the diminution of it, within the third or fourth generation, after their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe.</p>
            <p>By whom this <hi>Engliſh</hi> Paraphraſe of the <hi>Pſalms</hi> was made, and how advanced to ſo favourable a reception, not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the vulgar (who pleaſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the Tune, had little regard to the ſenſe of what they ſung) but among many the great, the wiſe, and truly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent of our Nation, may be worth enquiry, to the explication, or further illuſtration of that clauſe in the Deans Letter, which put me upon the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
            <p>The two principal we have, expreſsly named, in the Printed Title Page before the Book, <hi>Thomas Sternhold</hi> and <hi>John Hopkins;</hi> the former, Groom of the Privy Chamber, who is ſaid to have tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated only thirty ſeven of the <hi>Pſalms;</hi> the latter, one of thoſe who fled <hi>England,</hi> and reſided at <hi>Geneva</hi> in Q <hi>Maries</hi> days; to whom, I think, we are to attribute
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:174332:19"/>the Tranſlation of ſo many (and no more) as have <hi>J. H.</hi> the Capital Letters of his Name, prefixed to 'em; the firſt of which (as I turn 'em over) appears to be the 24, where a break is to the 27, and thence again to the 30, giving way to <hi>T.

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:174332:22"/>brought over with 'em from <hi>Geneva:</hi> For I cannot ſuppoſe any one individual perſon would be ſo bold, without counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of a packt Society, or Aſſembly, to impoſe upon a National Church, <hi>what</hi> Metrical <hi>Pſalms</hi> ſhall be Sung, and <hi>when,</hi> to the diſcharging thoſe Sacred and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical Hymns in Proſe, before appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by expreſs publick order, to be <hi>Said,</hi> or <hi>Sung,</hi> being ſet to more ſolemn Tunes as practis'd in our Cathedrals, ſuch as will carry up any truly devout Soul, in holy raptures, or fix it in holy ecſtaſies, much ſooner than the effeminate notes (as <hi>Strada</hi> calls 'em) of <hi>Marot,</hi> or the flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Symphony made of <hi>Sternhold, Hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins,</hi> and the reſt, by our Fanatick peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:174332:24"/>errour, or gives the lie to him that utters matter of his own invention, inſtead of divine infuſion, not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, or not believing, what he in prick-ſong affirms he does. I enter not into ſtrict Scrutiny of what therein they have done; but deſire any intelligent and indifferent perſon to take into due conſideration the Proſe and Metre of St. <hi>Athanaſius</hi>'s Symbol (if <hi>theirs</hi> in Verſe we may call <hi>his</hi>) and then ſeriouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve me, Whether he can, with half that vigour and aſſurance, declare his aſſent to the one as to the other; ſo much abatement being, by the inartifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Verſion, in the grandeur of ſtyle, ſo much diſtance in the elevation of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, from the language of the Saint himſelf, though tranſlated, and that of the Poet, though ſlickt in Rhime, enough to vilifie a mans Faith, in his own conceit, and damp his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to ſing, or ſay, what is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of it; for confiderate men will not eaſily advance ſo far, as to exclude altogether from Salvation all ſuch as have not faith enough in the fancy of a pitiful and pieviſh Poet; we know what ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or difficulty, has been made, by
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:174332:24"/>many ſober perſons, at the concluſive Sentence of that <hi>Creed</hi> in Proſe, who do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in no contentious, but a conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious motive, a dread to denounce Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againſt ſuch as otherwiſe they eſteemed their good <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Brethren; I ſhall only blame their diffidence in the tradition of the Church, which ever held it as a moſt Orthodox and Pious Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe of the Apoſtles Creed: And I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member very well (with circumſtance of time and place) when a learned perſon conſulted this Reverend Dean, <q rend="inline">Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a man might not ſafely remit ſomewhat of that rigour, and yet not deviate, culpably, from the common path others trod in; or, at leaſt, omit joining with the Miniſter in that ſo determinate concluſive Sentence:</q> His Reverence's Anſwer, in good earneſt, was to this purpoſe; <q rend="inline">He could be no good <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> nor true Son of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that did not <hi>animitus,</hi> and entirely, aſſent unto that <hi>Creed,</hi> ſay it, or ſay it not.</q>
            </p>
            <p>You ſee, Sir, how many eſſential parts of our Church-Service they have thus entrench'd upon, whereof, if they would have made a continued ſequence,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:174332:25"/>and but inſerted, as they uſe to do, while they take breath, a Chapter or two of their own chuſing, to be read by a Lay-Elder, as in the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Churches, their Miniſter would have found little or nothing for him to do, but to uſher in his Sermon with a long-winded Prayer, and ſo our Liturgy, as they would have it, had been defeated by a meer <hi>Chant,</hi> as in foreign parts they have ſaid our Religion become nothing elſe but a bare <hi>Preach.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If hereunto I ſhould add any Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or Animadverſions on the matter of thoſe <hi>Geneva</hi>-ditties, yea, and the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> as they have order'd it, a great deal of ignorance and folly, and ſomewhat worſe, would be diſcovered. In vain therefore do they pretend them, in the Title-page, that they (the <hi>Pſalms</hi> I mean) have been conferred with the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord no better with thoſe in our Pſalter, nor with the other in the Biſhops Bible; and moſt impudently do they obtrude upon us a publick allowance of them by the Queen, or Government, as muſt needs be meant, when no ſuch thing could be found, though an argument was held about it, in the High Commiſſion.</p>
            <pb n="47" facs="tcp:174332:25"/>
            <p>Now Sir, if you pleaſe, we will paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel their deſigns, which look ſo like one another, that of the <hi>Huguenots</hi> in <hi>France</hi> together with the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> in other Countreys, and that of our Separatiſts, or <hi>Puritans,</hi> here in <hi>England,</hi> which will appear, alike, the Setting up of a new Religion, and, in the iſſue, a new mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delling of the State too: Theirs was to confound the Maſs, and ours the Mattins, with the Veſpers, daily ſung on both ſides the water. Theirs, to make their Populacy, no leſs than their Clergy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in Divine Offices; ours, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude, or out, the conforming Miniſtry from practiſing their Canon and Rubrick comfortably, when they obſerved moſt of what they were appointed to do anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by their <hi>Pſalms</hi> and <hi>Songs</hi> in Metre, and ſo little or nothing leſt them of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy duty; and whereſoe're they might have a Nonconforming Miniſtry of their own, having a better eſteem of the open Fields and Barns, to meet in, both for Singing and Preaching too, than of our Churches, or Steeple-houſes, as they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther call 'em; experience hereof we have had all along among <hi>Scotch</hi> and <hi>Engliſh;</hi> nor would the <hi>Dutch</hi> have done other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:174332:26"/>if they fought not out better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions for themſelves than could the <hi>French,</hi> and ſo chang'd the publick face of Religion, and therewith the ancient Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of their Countrey.</p>
            <p>The Foreign Proteſtants, as I have ſhewed you, made uſe of <hi>Marot</hi>'s and <hi>Beza</hi>'s <hi>Pſalms,</hi> to cheriſh and encourage one another in their Rebellious attacks and Sacrilegious ſpoils: The <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> have employed theirs to a like good purpoſe, but what their Poets name was, I have not hitherto been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed: Our <hi>Puritans</hi> have done the like, in our late Civil Wars, with <hi>Stern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold</hi> and <hi>Hopkins,</hi> when they have gone about to charge their more Loyal Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-men then in Arms for the King, as may be made good from their forces in <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> and other Countries. Nay, I fear, we have outdone the Foreigners in one very profane practice I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that I mean, is, libelling parties, yea, and ſingle perſons, in the choice of a <hi>Pſalm,</hi> the ſenſe whereof ſhall be forced to reproach a Sentence judicially pronounced at the end of ſome ſuit at Law, and ſometimes to ridicule confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the order of our Church. That
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:174332:26"/>our Rebels guilt made them jealous of the like project in thoſe whom they ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected for more Legal principles than their own, is not amiſs noted from that act of folly, if not more criminal, I have read perpetrated by <hi>Iſaac Penington, Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>'s Lord Chief Juſtice in his time, who ſent a fellow to <hi>Newgate</hi> (perhaps a Clerk of ſome Church there) only for ſetting a Malignant <hi>Pſalm,</hi> as he did another for Reading a Malignant Chapter, poſſibly the 13th to the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſuch a one as he would have had encerped (among many others) toward conſtituting a new <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crypha,</hi> to ſecure a Scriptural Canon (if he and other ſuch miſcreants could have compiled it) to countenance their Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, (as they did in miſapplied Texts too often) by Holy Writ. Some other improper uſes they made of 'em, as at their City Feaſts, in the place of more artificial Muſick, that commonly attend ſuch entertainments. And as an hypocritical property, to gain the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Piety, in the ſtrict obſervance of family-duties, as they call them, whereof ſome of their own Children have taken notice, as did that Boy, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reproached by his Play-fellow, That
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:174332:27"/>they Sung no <hi>Pſalms</hi> upon Sabbath days in the Evening, as his Father and the reſt did at <hi>their</hi> Houſe; received this in anſwer with too much truth, as the young Gameſter ingenuouſly meant it, That the reaſon why at his Fathers houſe no <hi>Pſalms</hi> were wont to be Sung, was becauſe <hi>they had no Window toward the ſtreet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many odd paſſages, in reference to thoſe <hi>Pſalms,</hi> have affected the minds of moſt judicious perſons, whoſe ears they have arrived, but none, upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, have, in their merriment, made more reflections, in contempt and ſcorn of our Religion, which they will needs ſuppoſe, either allows or tolerates 'em, than ſome in the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, who, to my knowledge, mimically ſing their Tunes, and act ſuch Farces, with ridiculous circumſtances as have been credibly reported to 'em, obſerving alſo the ruſticity of their language, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſonancy of their Rhime, as no man in his right mind, can better temper an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe of what he muſt not diſown, than by a ſmile and ſilence.</p>
            <p>To what end they were firſt ordained, may be ſhrewdly gueſſed by the critical
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:174332:27"/>ſeaſon of their compoſition, which, we read, was about the ſame time, when by the formality of a Commiſſion, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with the irregularity of Riotous and Sacrilegious people, not only the Plate and rich Ornaments of the Altars were ſeized on in the Kings name <hi>E.</hi> 6. for their own commodity; but moſt fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture of all ſorts, belonging to the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Quires throughout the Realm, were rifled, and the very ſtructures in a great part demoliſhed or defaced, (that in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Cathedral it ſelf not eſcaping) as if ſo well the daily Sacrifice of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God in Pſalms, and Hymns, and Spiritual Songs, whatſoever the new Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy order'd otherwiſe) were thence to be exterminated, as that of the Maſs. They that had ſuch apprehenſion, or other conceit in fancy for innovation, might eaſily be induced to entertain this new device, at leaſt in their private Houſes, and as formerly they had been gratified with the priviledge of reading the Scripture in our vulgar language, ſo now be yet more pleaſed with the liberty they might enjoy, at will, of ſinging their Pſalter, thus Poetically improved, in the ſame. Howſoever, this may be,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:174332:28"/>not invidiouſly, nor partially, obſerved, from the firſt publication of 'em; that they were by none more regarded, nor more eagerly contended for, than by thoſe that were moſt ſeditiouſly inclined, and diſaffected to the eſtabliſhed order of the Church, which in this particular, among others, was carefully provided for, eſpecially after the coming of the preciſe Brethren from <hi>Geneva,</hi> where they had not only learned from their great Maſter <hi>Calvin,</hi> a new Inſtitution, or Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem of Religion, but acquainted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves well with his ſubtile methods of Sacriledge, or Sequeſtation of any Church Revenue, which they could pretend to have been ſuperſtitiouſly employed, that is, in more truth, applied to the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal decency, or ſolemnity of Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and Religious Worſhip of God in his Holy Temple; for little leſs than a ſuſpicion of Rapine, in ſome ſuch ſort, ſeemeth to be implied in the 49 <hi>Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> whereunto it oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs, thus;</p>
            <q>
               <p> Becauſe in divers Collegiate, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſome Pariſh Churches heretofore, there have been livings appointed for the maintenance of Men and Children
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:174332:28"/>to uſe ſinging in the Church, by means whereof the laudable ſervice of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick hath been had in eſtimation, and preſerved in knowledge: the Queens Majeſty neither meaning in any wiſe, the decay of any thing that might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently tend to the uſe and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the ſaid Science, neither to have the ſame in any part ſo abuſed in the Church, that thereby the Common Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſhould be the worſe underſtanded of the hearers, willeth and commandeth, that firſt no <hi>alterations</hi> be made of ſuch <hi>aſſignments of living,</hi> as heretofore hath been appointed to the uſe of <hi>Singing</hi> or <hi>Muſick</hi> in the Church, but that the ſame ſo remain. And that there be a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt and diſtinct Song ſo uſed in all parts of the Common Prayers in the Church, that the ſame may be as plainly underſtanded, as if it were read with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſinging, and yet nevertheleſs, for the comforting of ſuch that delight in Muſick, it may be permitted, that in the beginning, or in the end of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayers, either at Morning or Evening, there may be ſung an Hymn, or ſuch like Song, to the praiſe of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, in the beſt ſort of Melody
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:174332:29"/>and Muſick that may be conveniently deviſed, having reſpect that the Sentence of the Hymn may be underſtanded and perceived.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>My Remarks upon which Injunction are theſe:</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That not only in Cathedrals, but in ſome Parochial Churches alſo, means had been ſetled upon Singing-men and younger Choriſters, to begin, and carry on the Solemn Tunes of the <hi>Pſalms</hi> in Proſe, as they are, Verſe after Verſe, prickt out by a <hi>middle diſtinction</hi> to that purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the ſaid ſettlement advanced the eſtimation of Muſick, accounted a laudable Service, when diligently attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and performed according to the true intent, and firſt inſtitution thereof.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That evident enough it is, the Queen either <hi>had</hi> been moved, or appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended ſhe <hi>ſhould</hi> be, to divert the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues</hi> of ſuch Livings to other uſes; elſe, why was her Majeſty ſollicitous to open her mind in an unneceſſary caution againſt what no body thought on but her ſelf.</p>
            <pb n="55" facs="tcp:174332:29"/>
            <p n="4">4. That if any did (as ſuch Harpies may have been about her) Her Majeſty very piouſly and generouſly diſcouraged the attempt, by diſclaiming all thought or meaning, <hi>to authorize or countenance it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. That her Majeſty ſecured the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar convenience and complacence, by ordering Plain-Song, and continuing the Common Prayer intelligible by ſuch as would be attentive to it, accordingly Sung.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That for the more Muſical Ears, and diſtinctive Judgements in that Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, her Majeſty provided pecular Hymns, in ſome better Melody, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending thereby to cheriſh or gratifie the <hi>Curious,</hi> but adminiſter Comfort to <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> Souls, prediſpoſed ſo to apply it.</p>
            <p>From all which I conclude, That <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Sternhold</hi> and his Mates, or Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, were, unknown to the Queen, ſet upon their Poetical task by ſome that had in deſign not only to chace the more ſolemn Muſick out of the Church, but to divert, or appropriate, to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Livings and maintenance of it, if it could be obtained, or extorted, from the Superiour Power; for why elſe ſhould
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:174332:30"/>the Queen ſtart the ſcruple? Or why might they not hope to be altogether ſo ſucceſsful in Sacriledge here, as their elder Brethren had been in foreign parts?</p>
            <p>Howſoever, the induſtrious proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this new invention, cannot, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different and rational perſons, be judged to conduce ſo much as the former Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial, and preſent Cathedral practice, either to the ſolemnity of our Service, or one principal end of our Reformation, <hi>viz.</hi> the intelligibility of what is Said or Sung in the Church, unleſs Art and Science be poſtponed to Ignorance; or our Rhimical Singers have a ſingular ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity of Senſe, or facility of the Ear, which no body muſt pretend to but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>For let any perſon, indifferently diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, (though otherwiſe but meanly qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified to be judge in the caſe) ſincerely and ingenuouſly anſwer me, Whether makes the more ſolemn and devoutly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting Muſick, our Cathedral harmony regulated by a skilful Quire, according to their Science; or the flat aſymphony, the jarring diſſonancy (<hi>diſcordia diſcors,</hi> in good earneſt) of an ignorant confuſed
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:174332:30"/>multitude, met in a Parochial Church, where is, of courſe, but one pitiful <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cento,</hi> if the Clerk be any.</p>
            <p>And Secondly, Whether the like atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionhad to both, the <hi>Pſalms</hi> in Proſe, as chanted in the former, be not by far more diſtinctly intelligible, than the rude Rhimes ſcreamed and ſnuffled out in the latter.</p>
            <p>But, you will tell me, Although not Order, Cuſtome, more naturally preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, has provided againſt that defect in many Churches, and may be brought into the reſt at the peoples pleaſure, <hi>viz.</hi> by the Clerks diſtinct reading every line before the Congregation ſings it.</p>
            <p>This, I confeſs, gives us a copy of ſome little countenance, in anſwer to the objection, but not enough to bear it ſelf up againſt other inconveniences, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decencies obſerved in that practice by Wiſer Men than they that offer to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote it: Elſe, certainly, the Right Reverend and moſt judicious Biſhop <hi>Wren</hi> would not have made a like enquiry after it, as after other enormities in his Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of <hi>Norwich;</hi> the 49th Article at his Viſitation being this:</p>
            <pb n="58" facs="tcp:174332:31"/>
            <q>
               <p> If any <hi>Pſalms</hi> be uſed to be ſung in your Church, before or after the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Evening Prayer, or before or after the Sermons (upon which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions only, they are allowed to be ſung in Churches) is it done according to that grave manner (which firſt was in uſe) that ſuch do Sing as can Read the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> or have learned them by heart: and not after that uncouth and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent cuſtome of late taken up, to have every line firſt read [by one alone] and then ſung by the people?</p>
            </q>
            <p>Thoſe words <hi>[by one alone]</hi> were inſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed afterward, when his Lordſhip urged the ſame Article in his Dioceſs of <hi>Eley,</hi> whither he was tranſlated; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint made of the Article to the Long Parliament, by the factious <hi>William Prynne,</hi> Compiler of a Book entituled, <hi>Canterburies Doom,</hi> pag. 372.</p>
            <p>And, to the excluſion of thoſe Rhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming <hi>Pſalms</hi> out of the Service, where they are too frequently intruded, by popular conſent, his Lordſhip had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be inſerted a peculiar clauſe in another diſtinct Article, which was this:</p>
            <pb n="59" facs="tcp:174332:31"/>
            <q>
               <p> —After the Leſſons, doth he [your Curate] uſe no other <hi>Pſalm</hi> or <hi>Hymn,</hi> but thoſe which the Book of Common Prayer hath appointed?</p>
            </q>
            <p>For his Lordſhip, among other excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, ſo exact a Critick in our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and obſerver of ſenſe with its co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence, (neither of which but tript too frequently in the <hi>Geneva</hi>-Paraphraſe) ſince he could not ſuddenly repair all breaches, nor reſtrain all extravagances, which the Foreigners of ſeveral Nations had occaſioned in his Dioceſs of <hi>Norwich,</hi> was reſolved by degrees to turn the ſtream into its proper Channel, and keep it clear from mixing with the muddy waters of the Lake, whereof Nature ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given a precedent, his Lordſhip un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood a like poſſibility, by due care, in the current order of the Church.</p>
            <p>As to which Foreigners above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, I ask your leave, Sir, here to ſay, If they had prudently and modeſtly uſed the Royal Grant of Indulgence to 'em, from time to time, of all they at firſt made known, themſelves then ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped or wiſhed, <hi>ſc.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That here they might enjoy the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Conſcience, and Safety for their

            </p>
            <p>If <hi>John a Laſco</hi> the <hi>Polonian,</hi> inſtituted firſt Superintendant of that Society, or Corporation, could have been content with the free and quiet fruition, enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, uſe and exerciſe of all they had asked, according to the words in their Patent —<hi>Libere &amp; quiete frui, gaudere, uti, &amp; exercere;</hi> for aſſurance of all

            <p>If <hi>John a Laſco,</hi> like a falſe Lown, a ſly Serpent, lying cloſe under the leaves of the foreſaid Patent, had not watched, and when he eſpied an unhappy rupture, upon a ſlight occaſion, beginning to be made in our Church, glided out of his covert, on purpoſe to ſoment the Schiſm, and encreaſe it; ſo far wretchedly abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Kings goodneſs, as to appear in favour of the <hi>Zuinglian</hi> and <hi>Calvini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> faction, ſo early got over hither.</p>

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:174332:35"/>than as I was prompted to bring 'em in upon that occaſion, having ſhewed before, that from <hi>them</hi> was borrowed the uncouth cuſtome, and at length incorporated, by <hi>their</hi> prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, with the practice of our <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> among the Symbolic Characters of Proteſtant Reformation; yet, before I part with it, I ſhall take the freedome to acquaint you with one affected in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, of my perſonal obſervation, act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by 'em, in the preſence of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, at the Royal Chapel of St. <hi>James</hi>'s, few years ſince; where, one <hi>Sunday</hi> in the afternoon, his Majeſty being pleaſed to hear an eloquent, and much famed Preacher in the <hi>French</hi> language, I, as ordered, and of courſe, read Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſaying the Hymns, <hi>Magnificat,</hi> &amp;c. as appointed in our Rubrick; when on a ſudden, unexpectedly, ſome of the Foreigners there aſſembled began one of <hi>Marot</hi>'s Pſalms, immediately followed by many more, until inhibited by the hand; as if they had not known <hi>where,</hi> and <hi>before whom</hi> they were, perſwaded, doubtleſs, that our Office had been imperfect, if not unſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:174332:36"/>(in Dr. <hi>Heylins</hi> expreſſion) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch a <hi>Pſalm.</hi> And the very ſame licence, with leſs guilt, though not without fault, and faction too, have our own people, of the like zealous ſort, taken in Parochial Congregations, where they knew their Miniſter (diſaffected to <hi>Sternhold</hi>'s and <hi>Hopkins</hi>'s, with the others metre) muſt needs be diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in the ſerious and ſolemn thoughts he brought with him to Church, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted in his Office, and put upon an uncertain iſſue of his complaint, if at leaſt the Biſhops Chancellour of the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, to whom he made it, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable to affect thoſe <hi>Pſalms,</hi> one of which they had urged into the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice without his leave, and in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the better order of our Church. Whereupon it may not impertinently be obſerved, That <hi>Tho. Sternhold</hi>'s tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or <hi>Engliſh</hi> Paraphraſe of the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> was entered on about the ſame time when King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth's firſt Common-Prayer-book was ſetled, and, among other things, order taken for the <hi>Singing,</hi> or <hi>Saying,</hi> the <hi>Pſalms</hi> in Proſe, with the Hymns in their proper
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:174332:36"/>places: And what was then project<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it (for a project we may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it was) is more openly practis'd at this day, with the ſame intention, to defeat that order, and more than that, as they can prevail, particularly the 36 Injunction of Q. <hi>Eliz. That no man ſhall willingly let—or diſcourage, any Curate, or Miniſter, to</hi> ſing, <hi>or</hi> ſay, <hi>the Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice now ſet fourth,</hi> &amp;c. And yet ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than ſo, the fact infringeth the 15th Canon of the Synod at <hi>Laodicea,</hi> held about the year 364. which, though objected, in another caſe to be but a Provincial Council, and of very little authority in the Church, the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Dean of <hi>Peterburgh,</hi> in his <hi>Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtical Hiſtory,</hi> pag. 62. affirms it to be a Council that conſiſted of divers Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, or Regions of <hi>Aſia,</hi> which makes it greater than any Provincial Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod. Secondly, That it was always held to be of great Veneration and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Church, (and why ſhould it not be of like e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem with us?) <hi>antiqua nobilitate cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berrimum—Graecorum atque Latinorum Scriptis celebri memoriae commendatum,</hi> as

            <p>By which, according to the learned Patriarch <hi>Th.

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:174332:37"/>Reformation, were to ſing in the Church and none elſe, ſays the Anſwerer to Liturgical demands, which at this day is no otherwiſe obſerved by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts</hi> themſelves than in <hi>Balſamon</hi>'s ſenſe, newly recited to you.</p>
            <p>Now, as the Singers were limited, ſo were the <hi>Pſalms</hi> too, by the 163 Canon in the Code, the very laſt of the <hi>Laodicean</hi> Council, thus, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

            <p>The <hi>Greek Scholiaſt</hi> ſays, that, beſide the 150 <hi>Pſalms,</hi> that are called <hi>Davids,</hi> there were others, that went under the name of <hi>Solomon,</hi>

               </gap>, &amp;c. that they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed in variety of Verſe and Rhime; ſuch are they this Council diſallows the uſe of in the Church; and care enough was taken by our Reformers to prevent
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:174332:38"/>the like abuſe, until our <hi>Calviniſtical Puritans</hi> grew bold, and packt with the like-affected <hi>Stationers</hi> to impoſe upon publick authority for private ends; which can be no more juſtified, I mean <hi>Singing</hi> their <hi>Pſalms,</hi> as pitifully para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſed, in Church-Aſſemblies than the <hi>Reading</hi> Books Apocryphal, that are truly ſuch, and ſo, of old accounted; for thoſe are not ſuch, though called ſo, that are bound up, moſtly with our Bibles, but Eccleſiaſtical, ſome parts of which, you know, Sir, are ſelected, and appointed to be read, at certain times as firſt of the two Leſſons in the Church, there being other more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtyled Apocryphal, as our Reverend Dean hath demonſtrated the exact diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, from ancient and modern Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, in his Scholaſtical Hiſtory; and both ſo <hi>Reading,</hi> and <hi>Singing,</hi> are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by the Fathers in this Councel, as it follows in the Canon, <hi>aut libros. non-canonicos, ſed ſolos canonicos veteris et novi Teſtamenti,</hi> the irregularity being the ſame, of Singing non-canonical <hi>Pſalms,</hi> as of reading Apocryphal Books, in our publick Aſſemblies, and one no
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:174332:39"/>leſs than the other inhibited by this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</p>
            <p>Nor ought it to paſs unobſerved, That the Pſalter is a peculiar part, or portion of the Canon, the uſe whereof is intimated by the very title, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, of a like Divine inſtitution to be <hi>Snng,</hi> as dictated by the Holy Spirit, ſo well as the other Books to be <hi>Read</hi> as they are penned by the ſacred Writers, without the diſguiſe of a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe; for the two and twenty Books of the Old Teſtament are thus divided; twelve Hiſtorical, five Prophetical, four Paranetical, or of Doctrine and Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (as our Reverend Dean tranſlates <hi>Leontius Byzantinus</hi>) and one of Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mody; Now for our <hi>Puritans</hi> to tell God plainly (as, in effect, they do) That they like not to Sing the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> as he hath inſpired and left them, but will have them in their own Rhime, and Meeter, is no leſs unſufferable, and profane, than if they ſhould reject the <hi>Song of Solomon,</hi> becauſe we have it in Proſe; or paraphraſe the other Sacred Hymns, that are diſperſed in the Holy Bible, and prefer them to the ſame,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:174332:39"/>as they find them, without any ſuch <hi>Metamorphoſe,</hi> in the Canon.</p>
            <p>But in ſtretch of time (which muſt not be forgotten) providence permitted theſe Singulariſts to be payed home in their own kind, as Doctor <hi>Heylyn</hi> hiſtorizeth, more at large, than I ſhall take liberty to tranſcribe; for their brethren of the Second Separation became ſo licentious, as in their three kinds of ſpiritual Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, <hi>Praying, Propheſying,</hi> and <hi>Singing</hi> of <hi>Pſalms,</hi> they would be under no kind of reſtraint, but, as to the third, we are treating of, propoſed theſe Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. 1. Whether in a <hi>Pſalm</hi> a man muſt be tyed to Meeter, Rhime, and Tune? and, Whether Voluntary be not as neceſſary in Tune and Words, as well as Matter: and, 2. Whether Meeter, Rhimes, and Tune, be not quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Spirit.</p>
            <p>According to which Reſolution of the New ſeparation, every man, when the Congregation ſhall be met together, may firſt conceive his own Matter in the Act of Praiſing; deliver it in Proſe or Meeter, as he liſts himſelf; and, in the ſame inſtant, chant out, in what Tune
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:174332:40"/>ſoever, that which comes firſt into his own head: Which would be ſuch a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible confuſion of Tongues and Voices, that hardly any howling or gnaſhing of Teeth can be like unto it, (they are the Doctors very words) under which deſerved cenſure, I leave the Songſters, or Separatiſts of both ſorts, to agree among themſelves, there being no like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood, upon the principles, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, by either party, of their agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with us, and conformity to the order of our Church,</p>
            <p>But, Sir, before I altogether quit the Subject, undertaken by me, upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Deans Letter, it is fit I give you ſome ſatisfaction, without demand, why I reſted not on the authority of his Reverence's opinion as ſummarily, and conciſely, written, but extended my ſearch ſo much further after matter of contradiction to ſo inveterate a cuſtom, that is radicated with the eſſentials of our Religion, and ſeems to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the Canon or Rubrick to eternal ſilence; wherein to deal ingenuouſly and frankly with you, the true reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide what you may collect from my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent

            <p>When, the War ended in the Weſt, I had with other my Lord <hi>Hoptons</hi> Servants, the benefit of his Lordſhips Articles, and liberty to leave <hi>England.</hi> The firſt opportunity I had to exerciſe my function was in the Iſle of <hi>Jerzey,</hi>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:174332:42"/>where, even after his Highneſs, the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> was gone for <hi>France,</hi> three or four of the Loyal Clergy kept up an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Congregation in St. <hi>Hilliars</hi> Church, beſide thoſe in the Caſtle; In my turn of Preaching, it happened once, my Text led me into a diſcourſe of Church-muſick, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental, and vocal, the latter giving me occaſion to mention our <hi>Pſalms</hi> in Meeter, not without ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the unskilful Paraphraſts, that undertake the task: But more againſt the abuſe, I had obſerved, wrought by ſome Seditious Pariſh-Clerks, or other malicious people, that ſuggeſted ſuch, or ſuch, a <hi>Pſalm</hi> to be ſet, in a juncture of time, or buſineſs, that the like affected in the Congregation underſtood very well, what intereſt they ſerved, or party therein they gratified; nor was this practice inconſiderable in the very fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the grand Rebellion; for what I ſpeak, in that ſort, if I might expect no thanks, I knew no reaſon, why I ſhould apprehend a cenſure, from any intelligent, and indifferent, perſon then
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:174332:42"/>preſent, having uſed ſuch caution as might guard me from all juſt exception: But my ſelf-opinion was ſoon fruſtrate, by a call I had to attend a perſon of Honour (of which eminent quality di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers were then there) at his Chamber; whither being come, he immediately gave the meaning of his ſummons, the ſcandal he had taken at my Sermon the Sunday before, particularizing ſome invective words I uſed againſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure or ſtyle, and the authors too, of the Paraphraſe often mentioned. He was pleaſed to dilate more upon it, than ſo ſmall an errour deſerved (if an errour it had been) I attentively hearkned to all he ſaid, as in good manners, ſo in great hopes to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, that thoſe <hi>Pſalms</hi> had ſome better authority from above, than a bare allowance, which hath proved to be none, but as the <hi>Stationer,</hi> you find falſly pretends in the Title-page; I made no ſcruple at owning the ſumm of what he alledged, and gave ſuch reaſons in my own behalf, as I had ready; which could be anſwered with nothing but a popular Cuſtom, and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:174332:43"/>inſuperable prepoſſeſſion, which caſt forth ſomewhat to this purpoſe, <q rend="inline">If I had Preached the ſame in <hi>England,</hi> when times were more Sedate, and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop had not cenſured me, he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to have been cenſured, and that, rather than the cauſe ſhould have wanted proſecution himſelf would have been the Actor to purſue it.</q> I was ſomewhat troubled to ſee him ſo far tranſported, as not to take notice, that, though this practice of Singing the <hi>Pſalms</hi> in Rhime, together with ſome other of <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza's</hi> form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or countenancing, had run ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years on in our Church, like wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire, when the train is laid; yet no prudent Biſhop would urge his Clergy upon pretercanonical uſages, more than to preter-articulate Doctrines, without the publick authority, or private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, of the Supreme power, that, even in Eccleſiaſticks, is above him. But his Honours naming of a <hi>Biſhop</hi> called into my remembrance, that the very ſame words (for ſeldom, in ſuch Auditories, do I dare, at any time to vary from what my Pen prepares)
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:174332:43"/>I had ſome years before delivered the ſame words (I ſay) in S. <hi>Maries,</hi> the Right Reverend Doctor <hi>Brownrigg,</hi> then not only Biſhop, but Vice-Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, beſide other of the Conſiſtorian Heads, being preſent, from none of whom received I any check, nor ſo much as a frown, (obſerved) when I came out of the Pulpit. And a very learned Gentleman, now a worthy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late of our Church, coming a day or two after to my Chamber, on a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly viſit, moved me to let him read the whole Sermon over, which I yeild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the rather, becauſe I attributed much to his judgement, and was ſure of his integrity, not to conceal from me what he obſerved in it liable to cenſure, or capable of conſtruction in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an offenſive ſenſe; whereof nothing at all being ſpoken, I had no reaſon to forbear the ſame Language elſewhere, upon like occaſion, what I uttered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only this:</p>
            <q>
               <p> I am not at leiſure now to diſcuſs that opinion of <hi>Sanctius,</hi> for which he citeth <hi>Theodoret,</hi> that <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrel was no other than a <hi>Levite,</hi> who
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:174332:44"/>Sung ſome of <hi>Davids Pſalms</hi> unto him, which, it may be, in their pure natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, were, by far, diviner, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Muſick, than ſince, after the ill handling of ſome uncouth Poets, they became proſtitute in the mouths of licentious Zelots, and blind En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſts, whoſe ſenſual appetites too often hire their mercenary tongues to prophane this Muſick, while their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure thoughts are courting of their Miſtreſs.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Theſe lines as they lay, I read un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Honour, whereby it appeared, that I then named not the Paraphraſts, as he, being over-earneſt, alledged, I did, <hi>Hopkins</hi> at leaſt; wherein, yet, I had not been ſo bold with his name as the famed Court-Mercury had in the year 43. with that of a greater man, in the ſame caſe, when he writ thus, on the Rebels of that time.</p>
            <q>
               <p> But, let them be confident, they that are unborn, and cannot ſpeak now, will declare their admirable Rebellion to poſterity, ſo as they will be read upon every Poſt and Gate, in as honourable Rhimes, as
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:174332:44"/>Mr. <hi>Rouſe</hi> beſtowed upon the Singing <hi>Pſalms,</hi> a theme, (one would think) which deſerves better uſage.</p>
            </q>
            <p>And better uſage it had from a better Head, and neater Hand, of the more elegant Mr. <hi>George Sands,</hi> whoſe name I then uſed, wiſhing, if a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe we muſt have, that, or ſome ſuch, might be in it, wherein I would not refuſe to join with the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, when authorized to ſing it; ſo far was I from declaiming againſt all Singing of <hi>Pſalms,</hi> though I thought it very juſt, and not imprudent at all, to incline the people to a diſlike of that Paraphraſe, which had ſo many abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities (to ſay no worſe) in it, that I trembled to ſing them in the Houſe of God; adding, that my cloſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vective was meant againſt them I na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med not; principally the <hi>London</hi>-Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturers, and other of thoſe times, who ordinarily went into the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit with a Singing <hi>Pſalm,</hi> neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Liturgy to gain time for their own longer Prayer: Againſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon practice of Pariſh Clerks (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned) who, upon a Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannical ſuggeſtion, or fee given, by
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:174332:45"/>ſome male-content, or ill-principled perſon, would ſelect ſuch a <hi>Pſalm,</hi> as the words whereof might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the encouragement of Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Schiſm; to which ſaid his Honour, <hi>The more Fools the Miniſters that would ſuffer their Clerks to have the liberty of chuſing the Pſalms;</hi> not obſerving what <hi>Miniſters</hi> I aimed at, no whit better nor wiſer than their Clerks: But here he inſerted an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogative of ſome terrour, <q rend="inline">What if Mr. <hi>Gatford,</hi> the next <hi>Sunday,</hi> ſhould preach againſt ſtanding up at <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria Patri,</hi> being a thing brought in only by cuſtome, not command? accordingly as I had newly inſtanced againſt the Singing <hi>Pſalms:</hi>
               </q> To which, although I could have made a ſharp reply, knowing what Mr. <hi>Gatford</hi> had formerly ſaid and done, <hi>in Sacris,</hi> not only by the favour of Cuſtome, but againſt Canon: Yet I moderated my ſelf to this, ſaying, If there were the like reaſon for the one, as the other, and the like abuſe, let him do it; for though he <hi>might,</hi> I <hi>would not,</hi> put a pillow under any ones elbow, to give him eaſe, with the peril of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

I am aſhamed to let Poſterity know how little my fair Apology prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, where none at all ought to have been required; for after two or three hours diſcourſe on the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and ſomewhat elſe, I had preached about the Monaſtic life of the ancient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, who, we may be ſure, were no Papiſts; nor St. <hi>Baſil</hi> and St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi> Fathers of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Church, ſeparately taken, other than good Catholick Chriſtians; although I kept diſtance enough from what may be controverſial in the point, yet this perſon of Honour was pleaſed to tell me in plain terms, <hi>That he would have none of theſe new doctrines</hi> impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him in publick (as if the whole Aſſembly were contracted to his ſingle perſon) <hi>and if I would not
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:174332:46"/>forbear, he would refrain coming to Church.</hi> I preſume, he meant, when he ſhould know I was to preach, wherein I left him to his liberty, and preſerved my own, with no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment to abuſe it, in any affront to him, or others.</p>
            <p>Sir, This <hi>ſevere,</hi> not to ſay <hi>rough</hi> dealing I could not well digeſt, with the ſubmiſſion ſomewhat unreaſonably expected, but knowing no better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy at hand than the <hi>Catholicon</hi> of Patience, I made uſe of it in this, and many other conflicts, with more inferiour perſons, who, in many things, hated to be reformed according to the Canon of our Church, though fellow-ſufferers in our exile: Only hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I reſolved to conſult my betters, which happily produced this Letter from the Reverend Dean, whoſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was my Shield, many times, afterward, under the notion of a Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitary in our Church, until (by what accident I know not) the Letter it ſelf was dropt in ſome publick paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, taken up by the Lieutenant Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the Iſland, and with his
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:174332:46"/>own hand ſhortly after re-delivered to mine: It being ſo, by providence, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, as I ſince have accounted, for my neceſſary defence againſt the very urgent propoſal, though no direct im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition or command of ſome wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Prelates, my Right Reverend Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſans, ſince his Majeſties return, who took this particular, among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, into their comprehenſive method of moderation, and popular compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which I wiſh had effected the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union intended, and earneſtly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by 'em: If I may without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, Sir, I will report to you ſome inſtances I bear in mind, without any unbecoming reflexion upon their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; that may deſerve your cenſure, if I have not your approbation.</p>
            <p>When I came firſt to this Parochial Rectory, which I have now enjoyed ſomewhat above twenty years, inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ſelf, by what means I beſt could, touching the genius of my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, I found I had entred on a hard task of reducing them into the right path, from which they had diverted through the courſe of many years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:174332:47"/>my Predeceſſor having been miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led himſelf, and they by him, in the erroneous doctrines and practices of thoſe times; the later of the two was that alone, which I could hope in ſome meaſure to redreſs: for ſo well knew I the <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> after long acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as I had concluded him irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimable in his Doctrine, and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliable to much of the outward worſhip in our Church; what I knew I could beſt juſtifie by the character of my Order, and prudential rule of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment over them committed to me, without new direction from my Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, I ſeaſonably endeavoured, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving left no liberty to my Clerk, the very firſt day of my publick appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in this Church, to act any thing, on his part, but what he was expreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ordered by his rule and mine.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Pſalms</hi> in Meeter, I am treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, had been ſo endeared to them, (who underſtood little better ſenſe than what is unintelligible to him that hath moſt) it was ſuppoſed they would hardly part with them; and no leſs reſolved was I neither to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:174332:47"/>nor permit, the practice of what I could not conſcientiouſly joyn with them in, unleſs they could obtain an order to over-rule me, which I preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med my ſuperiours wiſer than to grant, upon any intereſt they could make, or the moſt importunate ſolicitation the boldeſt of them could uſe; yet I foreſaw well enough how far they would adventure for it, and meant to keep on the defenſive ſide, ſecured by the Rubrick after my ſaying the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene</hi> Creed; <hi>Then ſhall follow the Sermon,</hi> &amp;c. without the leaſt mention of any <hi>Pſalm</hi> to be Sung, before my paſſing to the Pulpit; I ſuffered my ſelf to be ſounded by the Church-wardens and ſome others, why I continued not the old Cuſtom, which they fondly thought ſoirreverſible, as they flatter themſelves, ſome other are, for non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payment of ſeveral Tythes, even with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>a modus,</hi> their Lawyer having found out a term worth ten of it, in <hi>Latin</hi> too, <hi>Lex Terra,</hi> which hath the efficacy to diſcharge all arrears, very potently, by paying nothing.</p>
            <pb n="92" facs="tcp:174332:48"/>
            <p>The addreſs, they agreed to make to the Biſhop, I no way offered to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct; nor did I much regard the open mouths of the many-headed monſter in the Countrey, that ſpent very freely, their deep reſentment of ſo great a grievance, untill I perceived ſome of better note, who had in poſſeſſion the Dromedaries of <hi>Midian</hi> and <hi>Ephah,</hi> who came from <hi>Sheba</hi> too, for ought that I know, but brought little or no Gold to the Church, and as little In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe to the name or reputation of her trueſt Prieſts, yet were very zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in ſhewing forth the praiſes of the Lord this way of Singing, caring not at all for the other; until I was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther certified, that my Lord Biſhop, then, of <hi>Sarum</hi> ſo countenanced them, as they took for granted, their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom-muſick ſhould be re-induced, and my moroſity reformed to a free com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance; for it was high time I judged, in that juncture, to provide againſt the <hi>dilemma</hi> I could not elſe avoid, either of diſobeying his Lordſhips <hi>Council,</hi> if not <hi>Command,</hi> (becauſe he had no Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, nor Rubrick, to authorize any
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:174332:48"/>ſuch Injunction) or be irregular in my obſervance, and act contrary to the higher obligation, laid upon me, as I ſuppoſed, in the eſtabliſhed Order of our ſervice (as I have ſhewed) for my obſerving which, I underſtood not, why any apology ſhould be made, if expected, or indeed could be, by me, without the guilt of either hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, or ſhame. Hereupon I truly ſtated the caſe to his Lordſhip, as I had done to my ſelf, promiſing all ſubmiſſion to his paternal Order, when directed to me; but refuſing to act ought without it, to gratifie a wilful people, in their digreſſion from the Order of our Church. His Lordſhip knew, better than I, what power he had to diſpenſe, and wherewith, which when he pleaſed to declare, in like manner, as in other caſes, I had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit faith enough to believe, that in purſuance of it I ſhould not do amiſs. I eaſily, Sir, perceived this ingenuous freedom did not relliſh well with his Lordſhip, and as ill ſatisfied was I to lye under the diſguſt of ſo Reverend a Prelate; the only expedient I could
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:174332:49"/>think of was, to wait ſome ſavoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable opportunity, in which fairly to obtain the ſenſe of the point in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence from ſome other worthy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late in no leſs eminency, if not in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than himſelf, whereby the cloud of miſpriſion might be diſpell'd, and their countenances cleared up, who had frown'd upon me for this unneceſſary, nice, reluctance, as they ſuppoſed; which ſoon after, finding in my way, I ſucceſsfully improved.</p>
            <p>My good Angel guiding me to the Lord Biſhop <hi>Sheldons</hi> Lodgings at <hi>White-hall</hi> in a good hour, when Lord Biſhop <hi>Henchman</hi> of <hi>Sarum</hi> came to viſit him. I being not permitted to go out, and leave them private, in ſome proper pauſe of their diſcourſe, took occaſion ſo far to accuſe my ſelf as to own, how at that preſent, I was unhappily fallen under my Dioceſans diſpleaſure, and craved leave of both to relate, for <hi>what,</hi> very briefly; which granted by their joint conſent, having render'd the ſumm of what had paſſed, I reduced all to this queſtion, propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing (with leave)</p>

               <p> Whether a Clergy-man were obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by his Oath of Canonical o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, to conform, in his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Offices, to the expreſs order of our Church, or with conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance only of his <hi>Dioceſan,</hi> take up, with others, an unauthoriz'd, unjuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Cuſtom, to rid himſelf, or his O dinary, from the importunity of an ill principled and miſguided peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. </p>
            </q>
            <p>The arguments for Canon, or Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick (which is equivalent) and the oppoſite, for prevailing Cuſtom, was preſſed ſo far as on either ſide they would bear; and my Lord of <hi>London,</hi> whoſe Tranſlation to the <hi>Metropolitan</hi> See of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was near approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, petitioned by me, to be (as I knew he would be) an impartial Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biter in the caſe. What my Lord of <hi>Sarum</hi> moſt ſharply inſiſted on was; <q rend="inline"> That no Parochial Prieſt ought to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in practice from that of his <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan;</hi> nor preſume to withdraw his Church or Congregation from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent of his Cathedral, that being lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle better, than to ſet up Altar againſt

            </p>
            <p>I humbly asked leave of his Lordſhip to make obſervation what advantage, unawares, he yeilded me, in parallel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the practice, he would have rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced into my Church, with that which already was, on ſolemn Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals only to gratifie an acceſſional Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory, that had not prayed with him, in his own, (the difference between them I ſhall make appear by and by) and his more charitable opinion of me, than to believe, I affected any thing, in matter or form, that tended toward any wilful oppoſition, or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous diſparity, in that I conformed, all I could, to what was practiſed in his Quire, to which alone I had regard, not concerning my ſelf with what his Lordſhip ſuffered (perhaps not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded) in the <hi>Nave</hi> of his Church, before his mixt aſſembly could be well ſetled, and the Preacher paſs from a greater diſtance to aſcend the Pulpit.

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:174332:50"/>been <hi>Sung</hi> ſo too, if my people were ſo well inclined to learn thoſe Tunes, as they were induſtrious to retrieve the other. And, if I may not be bold to ſay, what was taken up by Cuſtom in the <hi>Area,</hi> or body, of his Cathedral had not been <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſus Sarum</hi> from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Reformation; I would affirm, unlicenſed, that if I did the ſame in my Church, between the Leſſons, or Services, firſt, and ſecond, as my ignorant people fondly required, I ſhould then, indeed do little leſs than erect Altar againſt Altar, Meeter againſt Proſe, a lewd Chant againſt a ſolemn Harmony, both in matter and form, oppoſite, for I heard of no ſuch practice in the Quire of his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips Cathedral nor any other. Which difference between Quire and <hi>Naves,</hi> in the preſent caſe, being overlooked, or inobſerved, by his Lordſhip, exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me from cenſure, and juſtified my averſion from acting any thing, ſo contrary to the Rubrick, in our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer Book, at my urging which inadvertiſement, if ſo I may call it, his Lordſhip ſeeming to be ſomewhat
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:174332:51"/>ſurprized, my Lord of <hi>London</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſtarted up from the Couch, and, laying his hand gently on my Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſaid, as if he meant it in good earneſt, <hi>Hold thine own, man;</hi> which I was willing to interpret his award in the caſe, or determination of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion laid, and fairly diſcourſed, before his Lordſhip.

Reading the Communion-Service in the Desk, and not go up into the Chancel, he would ſee, that the moſt contentious of them all ſhould pay me, peaceably, the full due of my Tythes, without trouble, or ſuit at Law, which otherwiſe, he foreſaw, I would not be able to get in without charge and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance.</q> I underſtood, Sir, well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:174332:51"/>how much his affectual aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance might contribute to my Peace and Profit, yet was loth to purchaſe it at ſo dear a rate, as the forfeiture of my obſervance, or forbearance of my duty to the expreſs order of the Church; but, his power being great, if he would iſſue out from his Court a countermand to my Curate, and I found him influenced by it, when I came down into the Countrey (for we were then in <hi>London)</hi> I would not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continue what practice my Curate had entered on by his order, but leave the burthen of praetercanonical, or praeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubrical, acting in the Offices of the Church on him who was better able to anſwer it than my ſelf.</p>
            <p>So far was Sir <hi>William</hi> from taking offence at this my freedom, or becalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it, in the vindication of my title to ſome Tythes injuriouſly detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that being afterward entertained by me, as my Advocate in the <hi>Arches,</hi> notwithſtanding potent oppoſition, made upon a falſe and frivolous ſuggeſtion, over facilely hearkened to, he, by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of Law, and skilful Meſnage,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:174332:52"/>carried my cauſe on to the period of being in readineſs for a ſentence, which the Dean of the <hi>Arches</hi> openly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red he ought in juſtice, and equity, to pronounce on my part, and had done it if a prohibition had not iſſued from above, which traverſed the cauſe to another Judicatory (where it was skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully pleaded in my behalf by the late Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Sanders)</hi> at which Sir <hi>William</hi> was ſo much concerned, that having ſome Books and Papers in his hand, he threw them down with great indignation in the midſt of the Court, ſaying ſomewhat reſolutely to this purpoſe, If ſo juſt a cauſe as this muſt be wreſted from us, after a fair hearing, and ſentence ready to be pronounced for us, I will never act here in <hi>cauſa decimarum</hi> more: And, I think, he was ſo good as his word to his dying day.</p>
            <p>Sir, at the next occaſion of my waiting upon his Principal, the Right Reverend Biſhop <hi>Earles,</hi> though my buſineſs with him, at that time, was of a different nature, yet I could not eſcape a rubbing up of the old ſore, a
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:174332:52"/>mild reprehenſion for my outing, or diſuſing, the Singing <hi>Pſalms,</hi> to whom when I had made the like reply as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, I found, it neceſſary to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the copy of this very Letter of the Reverend Dean's, with whom his Lordſhip had been ſo intimate abroad in exile, as I might reaſonably ſuppoſe, this argument, among many other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to our publick practices in the Church, had not eſcaped their diſcuſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in private converſe: Having read it over, and returned the paper to my hand; he ſaid thus in ſhort, <q rend="inline">I do not queſtion this writing to be other than what you affirm it; but whatſoever was the Biſhops opinion then (for a great Biſhop was the Dean become after his Majeſties return) I am ſure he is now of another mind in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular of Singing <hi>Pſalms;</hi>
               </q> I cannot help that, my Lord, ſaid I, nor can I change the opinion I was confirmed in chiefly by this authority under his own hand (which I have to ſhew) until our Church doth change her Rubrick, or I may be otherwiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced. Soon after this I departed
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:174332:53"/>fairly, and enjoyed my freedom.</p>
            <p>Sir, If my Lord of <hi>D</hi>'s change of his opinion ſhould ſeem to invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date what before, the Dean of <hi>P.</hi> had not only declared, but freely argued, <hi>in Scriptis,</hi> to the contrary, in the faireſt conſtruction it may paſs but for an inſtance of the greater mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration his Lordſhip condeſcended to, and indulgence he yielded toward the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> party in his later days, upon better hopes, perhaps, of a friendly accommodation in greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters than hath been yet, or, in like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood, ever will be effected. And ſomewhat the leſs may I value it in the argument I am upon, ſince the ſenſe of our Univerſity therein hath been manifeſted, to the diſparagement of thoſe ill Paraphraſed <hi>Pſalms</hi> in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, by ſuppreſſing the uſe of them in St. <hi>Mary's</hi> Church, where ſo many years they had been tolerated to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the publick Preacher, though not without the diſlike and diſſatisfaction of many Reverend and Judicious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, moſt addicted to exact order, which they knew, by that Puritan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:174332:53"/>cuſtome, to have been notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly infringed, and the Authority of our Reformed Church ſcandalouſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted: Whereas if the generality of our heedleſs people were not carried away more by cuſtom than guided by reaſon or common-ſenſe, the proſaic Hymns might be without reluctance, reſtored to their primitive harmony in our ſervice, and thereby ſincere devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion exalted throughout all our Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, without deſign.</p>
            <p>Sir, I hope no ſuch raſh reflections upon the Reverend Perſonages I was fain to name, have paſſed my Pen, as may require your cenſure of my indiſcretion, or ill-nature, whom I know to be more ingenuous than to pervert plain dealing into a libellous Satyr; of what other men do, with more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, I muſt ſtand the hazard: They that are not of my opinion, (who account no man injur'd, by having his own ſentiments, when firſt made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick by himſelf, returned upon him) may enjoy the priviledge of a more ſtrict reſerve, and chaſtiſe me, as they pleaſe, with the diſcipline of my own
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:174332:54"/>making. As for them that will be angry, becauſe I vindicate my ſelf from what undeſervedly has been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to me, let them be angry ſtill, ſo you preſerve a kinder character for,</p>
